ABOUT:
The goal is to build a small chatbot of Game of Thrones-
Of course, using Botonic and with the following requirements:
- When the user talks for the first time, the bot should show a carousel with 3 different GoT Houses (chosen randomly). You should get the information from this public API (https://anapioficeandfire.com/). Each element of the carousel should have a button that, when clicked, should return the Words of that given House. If a House has no Words, it should not appear in the carousel. The image of the carousel should be generated using the DALL-E-3 API, you should pass the "coatOfArms" description provided in the GoT API to the DALL-E prompt.
- If the user says anything, the bot will simply use the Chat Completion API from OpenAI to generate a response. Use the GPT-4 model.
- Extra: adapt the webchat styles with GoT (anyway you like, use your creativity!).
- Extra: try to play a little bit with OpenAI prompts to achieve the best results for images and text generated (be creative here too!)
- Extra: try to make the bot respond as fast as possible.
